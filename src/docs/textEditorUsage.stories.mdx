# Using RichTextEditor

Currently, we use [**SunEditor**](https://github.com/JiHong88/SunEditor) as our WYSIWYG editor for admin panels.

The html code it produces includes some custom styles

So if we want to display some markup, generated via the RichTextEditor in the way as it looked in edit mode, we need to:

1. Wrap the displaying content in a `div` with class `sun-editor-editable`
2. Include this [**css file**](https://unpkg.com/suneditor@2.34.3/src/assets/css/suneditor-contents.css)
